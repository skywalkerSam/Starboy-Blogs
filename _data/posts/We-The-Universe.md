The universe shouldn’t exist, but it does. For some reason. And we don’t know why. The universe is a mystery – and so is the life that emerges from within it. The universe is too vast. The sheer vastness of it overwhelms our comprehension. Our imagination, however wild, exists within that vastness as a mere speck of dust in the night sky. There is no reason in particular for it to be there. it simply exists, a byproduct of things happening around it. it didn’t choose to be there. it exists simply because of the forces of attraction acting on the atomic layers of its existence – and because of the wind. Similarly, the wind didn’t choose to exist either, or to move it. it exists because the air molecules exist, and there’s a lot of it. Enough to make its own complex set of patterns. “Will does not exist” – or at least, not in the grand scheme of things. Or should i say, the quantum scheme of things? We’re free to do what we want, yes. But within the confines of our biological existence.

&nbsp; 

&emsp; Similarly, we, as a species, did not choose to exist. We exist simply because the Earth does. And again, the Earth itself did not choose to exist. it exists simply because of the forces of attraction beyond its control – gravity, in this case. We simply shouldn’t exist, but we do. For some reason. And we’re trying to find out exactly why. Look at us – Life searching for its own origins. The universe experiencing itself. Life does not make much sense, but we’re here – talking about it. Which is ironic, in its own way. Life is much, much more than our mere perception of it. We’re just here to bear witness to it all. Which is just terrifying and beautiful in the same thought.

While we exist, might as well make the best of it…
